1. add update and delete functions
2. add ai summary function for dates and functions to get ai summaries for any number of dates
3. add a way to detect the date clicked so the ai can respond directly based on the date click to show the events in sidebar and tell the user abt the day - NOPE - sidebar is enough
4. test if the ai can make multiple events for long running tasks or complicated tasks like a few reminders before the task occurs to make it easy for the user to remember - sort of memory function - ( need more complex and edge cases)
5. add conversational memory to the ai
6. add a UI highlight for today's day and date clicked
7. make sunday the first day rather than the last
8. add current date to system prompt
